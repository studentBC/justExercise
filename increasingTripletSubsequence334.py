#Intuition
#
#The idea is to keep track of the first two numbers in increasing order and find the last number which will be bigger than the first two numbers. Here, the first and second smallest numbers can be updated with conditional checks while scanning nums.
#
#first_num = second_num = some very big number
#for n in nums:
#    if n is smallest number:
#        first_num = n
#    else if n is second smallest number:
#        second_num = n
#    else n is bigger than both first_num and second_num:
#        # We have found our triplet, return True
#
## After loop has terminated
## If we have reached this point, there is no increasing triplet, return False
#Let's take a look at two cases where nums is sorted:
#
#If nums is sorted in descending order, you will always end up in this first if block (and thus, repeatedly updating first_num). Finally, False will be returned after the loop has been terminated.
#If nums is sorted in ascending order, you will first update first_num as soon as you see the first number in nums and when you encounter another number in nums, you will update the second_nums since this new number would be bigger than the value stored in first_num. After these two variables have been populated, all you need to look for is another number which is bigger than first_num and second_num. As soon as you find that number, the first if and the second else if blocks will be skipped, and you will end up in the last else block and True will be returned immediately.
#This works not only for sorted cases described above but also for cases where the numbers are unsorted. First, find the smallest number and store it in first_num, and then find the second smallest number and store it in second_num. However, there is no guarantee that another number you encounter in nums will be greater than first_num and second_num. This new number can even be smaller than then first_num (in that case, you will have to update first_num with this new value) or second_num (in that case, you will have to update second_num with this new value). As long as you encounter those cases, you keep on updating your first_num and second_num. As soon as you encounter a number which is greater than both first_num and second_num, you have found your last number to complete the increasing triplet subsequence. At that point, you can immediately return True.
#
#However, there is an important logic that is quite important to grasp. Let's take nums = [10,20,3,2,1,1,2,0,4] for an example:
#
#Current
#9 / 10
#In the above example, the point where you have reached 0 and subsequently updating first_num = 0 can make you confused as you might think that this no longer is a subsequence (since second_num = 2 comes before first_num = 0). Of course, since we have updated the first_num, if we want to return the actual subsequence, we might need to have another placeholder variable that will hold the previously recorded first_num before it is updated. However, for this problem, we are only looking for the existence of a valid increasing triplet subsequence, even though first_num and second_num are out of order, we don't need to worry about it.
#
#To make this more illustrative, observe the following example.
#
#nums = [1,2,0,3] # should return True
#
#first_num = 1
#second_num = 2
#first_num = 0
#return True
#The increasing triplet subsequence is 1, 2, and 3. Even though first_num is updated in Line 3, second_num is never updated again. However, you can tell that there exists another number before second_num which is definitely BIGGER than the last updated first_num but SMALLER than second_num. This is a very important observation. Therefore, you can safely say that there exists an increasing triplet subsequence as soon as you see a number which is bigger than the last updated first_num and second_num even though that last updated first_num is not one of the actual numbers of the increasing triplet subsequence.

class Solution:
    def increasingTriplet(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        first = float("inf")
        second = float("inf")
        for i in nums:
            if i <= first:
                first = i
            elif i <= second:
                second = i
            else:
                return True
        return False
