Explanation: The buyer with id 1 bought an S8 but did not buy an iPhone. The buyer with id 3 bought both.

# Write your MySQL query statement below
select distinct(buyer_id)
from Sales join Product using (product_id)
where product_name = "S8" and buyer_id not in (
    select buyer_id
    from Sales join Product using (product_id)
    where product_name = "iphone"
)

# 804 ms solution
SELECT DISTINCT s.buyer_id FROM Sales s
INNER JOIN Product p
ON s.product_id = p.product_id
WHERE p.product_name = 'S8'
OR p.product_name = 'iPhone'
GROUP BY s.buyer_id
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT p.product_name)=1 AND MAX(p.product_name)='S8'
